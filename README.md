# Behavior Driven Development in practice - Behat in Laravel
Behat on Laravel playground.

## Stage 1 - BDD Setup

Install laravel like usually, for example using:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel behat-presentation
```

Behat, as you will see soon is great test framework, but unfortunately poor supported by Laravel.
There is only one library, that supports Behat on Laravel from laracast, but... 
It dosn't work with new Laravel version, and seems to be not supported anymore.

We can fix that by updating some code, so I've created repository fork for that.
First, let's add repository to our composer file:

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/MWL91/Behat-Laravel-Extension"
    }
]
```

Now you are able to add required dev dependencies using:

```
composer require behat/behat behat/mink friends-of-behat/mink-extension laracasts/behat-laravel-extension:"dev-master as 1.1" --dev
```

After installation, we also need to configure our behat with behat.yml file. Create `behat.yml` file with contents below:

```
default:
  extensions:
    Laracasts\Behat:
      env_path: .env.testing
    Behat\MinkExtension:
      default_session: laravel
      laravel: ~
```

Our testing env will be .env.testing. We also will use laravel session, in case of using `Mink Extention` that allows us to do browser tests.

```
cp .env.example .env.testing
```

Also in our test we want to use sqlite database, so we will change database config to:

```
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
#DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

And create a new database.sqlite in database directory.

```
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Now we are ready to go with our environment using behat.

## Mink 1 - configure behat

Now, when we have our environment ready to go, we can start with initialize Behat.

```
vendor/bin/behat --init
```

This will create out first FeatureContext class, that we will use, to test our code.

We will start with extend FeatureContext class with Mink extension.

```php
use Behat\MinkExtension\Context;

class FeatureContext extends MinkContext implements Context
```

Now, when we run `vendor/bin/behat`, Bahat will tell us, that we don't have any scenarios and steps - time to create one.

## Mink 2 - ...

So, when we have configured our env, let's look at Mink tests.
Now, Mink allows you to test application like it would be browser tests.
