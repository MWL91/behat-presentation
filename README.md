# Behavior Driven Development in practice - Behat in Laravel
Behat on Laravel playground.

## Stage 1 - BDD Setup

Install laravel like usually, for example using:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel behat-presentation
```

There is one library, that supports Behat on Laravel, and unfortunately it's not supported.
